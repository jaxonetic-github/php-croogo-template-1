# Customizable Website for a Client

This is a PHP 5.4+ based site with Croogo 1.5 as CMS and powered by [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) MVC framework.

This is a work in progress based on a rushed job I did for a client.  There are parts (i.e. File uploads) where 
I need to do some refactoring because in the middle of development you can't optimize everything.  So I hang my head 
in shame at those parts. 

## Requirements
  * Apache with `mod_rewrite`
  * PHP 5.4 or higher
  * MySQL 4.1 or higher (`utf8_unicode_ci` collation)

## Installation

#### Installation using git  --Incomplete

  * Ensure you have a recent cakephp version 2.3
  * Run `git submodule update --init`
